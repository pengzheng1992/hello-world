\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:con}
In this paper, we explored the memory waste problem of per-flow counting.
Specifically, we propose a distributed counting approach on SDN, \ie, DIAL.
In contrast to only focusing on reducing the local switch memory, DIAL leverages the spared memory along the routing path to make a global optimization.
In this work, we formulate the problem of finding the optimal placement for the extra counting rules, and propose simple heuristics to fast generate a near-optimal solution.
The evaluation based on real and synthetic traces and topologies has demonstrated that DIAL is effective, efficient and scalable with various local optimization approaches.
